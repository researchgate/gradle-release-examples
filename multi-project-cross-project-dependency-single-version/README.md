# multi-project-single-version example

This is a simple example on how a multi project could look like and how the gradle-release plugin is configured.
In this example we use one version for all the projects.

## Usage

Fork the repository and checkout locally.

Then you can test executing the release by

```
$ cd multi-project-single-version
$ ./gradlew release
```

On windows you would do

```
$ cd multi-project-single-version
$ gradlew.bat release
```
