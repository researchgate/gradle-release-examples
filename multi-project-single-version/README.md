# multi-project-single-version example

This is a simple example on how a multi project could look like and how the gradle-release plugin is configured.
In this example we use one version for all the projects.
For this to work correctly, the release plugin should only be applied to the root project. Do not apply the plugin to subprojects.

## Usage

Fork the repository and checkout locally.

Then you can test executing the release by

```
$ cd multi-project-single-version
$ ./gradlew release
```

On windows you would do

```
$ cd multi-project-single-version
$ gradlew.bat release
```
